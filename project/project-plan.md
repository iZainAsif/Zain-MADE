# Project Plan

## Title
Climate Change Analysis in Top US States 

## Main Question

Relationship between the population of an area and the effect of climate change in USA States

## Description

This project explores how the number of people in U.S. states connects with the average temperatures from 2010 to 2019. I want to understand the patterns that might show up when looking at both state populations and the weather during this time.



## Datasources

### Datasource #1: State Population Totals and Components of Change: 2010-2019
* Metadata URL: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html
* Data URL: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2019/state/totals/nst-est2019-01.xlsx
* Data Type: xlsx

This dataset contains state population totals and components of change for years 2010 to 2019.  

### Datasource #2: Climate change in the contiguous United States
