## Title
Linking Writing Processes to Writing Quality

## Main Question

Is there is a relationship between writing behaviour and the final grade of an essay?

## Description


In this project, following problems will be addressed by using Machine Learning techniques:

Writing being a complex process involves various behaviors and brain activities like planning, revising, taking a break, and managing to write it before the deadline/time finishes. Our traditional wiring assessments only focus on the final product ignoring all the steps and brain thinking behind it. Previous research in this area was also limited due to low dataset.

We will use Machine Learning techniques by analyzing the keystroke log data provided as a dataset to uncover the key aspects of the writing process while aiming to establish relationships between a writer's behaviors during the writing process and the overall quality of their writing.  

This approach may also encourage the learners to pay more attention to how they write and how they can enhance their skills further in writing.
